# Utatte

**Utatte** is a web-based karaoke application with automatic scoring system using voice pitch detection. It offers simple-to-use menu and fully animated game screen (lyrics and piano roll).

> **Warning**
> This version of the application is proof-of-concept. Core elements are implemented, but the app is NOT failsafe. New version is now in development, but at this moment it is not ready for use. For now, to check out this application, I recommend this version, but keeping in mind it's just an alpha version. If you are interested in the new version, the source code is available here: https://github.com/szezjo/utatte2

> **Note**
> To use this application, API server has to be running in the background. You can find it here: https://github.com/szezjo/utatte-api

The application uses Yarn package manager. The first time you download the code use this command to install the dependencies:
```yarn install```

To run the application use:
```yarn dev```
